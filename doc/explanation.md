## Architecture

### Tasks

Tasks represent a single command that is run. They appear in the [task list](#task-list), where you
can manage them (start/stop/restart/edit/open terminal). You can create them directly with the
[new_task()](reference.md#new_taskopts) method. Most of the time, however, you will find it most
convenient to create them using [templates](#templates).

### Components

Tasks are built using an [entity component
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system). By itself, all a task does is run a
command in a terminal. Components are used to add more functionality. There are components to
display a summary of the output in the [task list](#task-list), to show a notification when the task
finishes running, and to set the task results into neovim diagnostics.

Components are designed to be easy to remove, customize, or replace. If you want to customize some
aspect or behavior of a task, it's likely that it will be done through components.

See [custom components](guides.md#custom-components) for how to customize them or define your own,
and [components](components.md) for a list of built-in components.

**Note**: both tasks and components are designed to be serializable. They avoid putting things like
functions in their constructors, and as a result can easily be serialized and saved to disk.

### Templates

Templates provide a way to construct a task, along with other metadata that aid in selecting and
starting that task. They are the primary way to define tasks for overseer, and they are what appears
when you use the command `:OverseerRun`.

When you want to add custom tasks that you can run, templates are the way to go. See [custom
tasks](guides.md#custom-tasks) for more.

## Task list

Control the task list with `:OverseerOpen`, `:OverseerClose`, and `:OverseerToggle`.

The task list displays all tasks that have been created. It shows the task status, name, and a
summary of the task output (controlled by the `on_output_summarize` component). You can show more or
less detail for a single task with `<C-l>` and `<C-h>` (by default), or for all tasks with `L` and
`H`.

`?` will show you a list of all the keybindings, and `<CR>` will open up a menu of all
[actions](guides.md#actions) that you can perform on the selected task.

When a task is disposed, it will be removed from the task list. By default, tasks will be disposed 5
minutes after they finish running (controlled by the `on_complete_dispose` component).

## Task editor

<img width="515" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-16 at 9 57 43 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/179364674-526c8cbc-0cd8-48b0-ad68-3140c10178eb.png">

The task editor allows you to change the components on a task by hand. You shouldn't need to do this
often (if you find yourself frequently making the same edits, consider turning that into an
[action](guides.md#actions)), but it can be useful for experimentation and tweaking values on the fly.

To open the editor for a task, use the `edit` action (open the overseer task list, `<CR>` on the
task, select `edit`).

For the most part you can edit the values like a normal buffer, but there is a lot of magic involved
to produce a "form-like" experience. For enum fields, you can autocomplete the possible values with
omnicomplete (`<C-x><C-o>`). To delete a component, just delete its name (`dd` works fine). To add a
new component, create a blank line (I typically use `o`). When you are done, use `:w` to confirm and
submit your changes.

## Alternatives

There are several other job/task plugins in the neovim ecosystem. To me, the main differentiating
features that overseer offers are **unparalleled extensibility** and the **most complete support for
VS Code's `tasks.json`** format. If you're still shopping around, these are the others that I'm
aware of:

## FAQ

**Q: Why do my tasks disappear after a while?**

The default behavior is for completed tasks to get _disposed_ after a 5 minute timeout. This frees
their resources and removes them from the task list. You can change this by editing the
`component_aliases` definition to tweak the timeout (`{"on_complete_dispose", timeout = 900}`), only
dispose succeeded/failed tasks (`{"on_complete_dispose", statuses = {"SUCCESS"}}`), or delete the
"on_complete_dispose" component entirely. In that case, tasks will stick around until manually
disposed.

**Q: How can I debug when something goes wrong?**

Run `:OverseerInfo` to view the available tasks and information about why certain tasks are not
available. It will also show you the location of the log file. If you need, you can crank up the
detail of the logs by adjusting the level:

```lua
overseer.setup({
  log_level = vim.log.levels.TRACE,
})
```

**Q: Can I use this to asynchronously lint my files on save?**

You absolutely can. All the pieces are here to build something like ALE, it just needs the configs
for different lint tools. Personally, I think that the existing plugin ecosystem has solved this
sufficiently well and I don't see a value add from building _another_ on top of overseer. I'm using
[nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint) in my own config and think it's great.
