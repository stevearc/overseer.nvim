# overseer.nvim

A task runner and job management plugin for Neovim

**BETA** - [APIs](#api) are not guaranteed to be stable, but a best-effort will be made to retain backwards-compatibility

Please leave feedback about what's hard, what's confusing, and where the documentation is lacking. I have a lot of plans for overseer, but I prioritize what's next based on requests.

## Features

Overseer was built to address two generic needs:

**1. Easily run and manage commands relevant to my current project**

- auto-detect tasks for common build systems (e.g. make, npm, tox)
- define your own custom tasks
- supports tasks from [VS Code's tasks.json file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks)

**2. Easily integrate the results of those commands with neovim**

- has built-in methods of parsing command output and loading it into neovim diagnostics, quickfix, or loclist.
- is _extremely_ customizable. It should be straightforward and simple to get the functionality you need.

Some examples of what overseer was built to do:

- Quickly run the relevant build command for a project (e.g. `make`)
- Run a web server in the background. Restart it on failure.
- Run a build process. Re-run it every time I make a change. If there are errors, show them in neovim diagnostics (and optionally load them into the quickfix)

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.7+
- (optional) patches for `vim.ui` (e.g. [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim)). Provides nicer UI for input and selection.
- (optional) [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim). When used with [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) provides best selection UI.
- (optional) [nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify) a nice UI for `vim.notify`

## Setup

Somewhere in your init.lua you will need to call `overseer.setup()`. Don't worry about lazy loading; overseer lazy-loads itself!

```lua
require("overseer").setup({
  -- Default task strategy
  strategy = "terminal",
  -- Template modules to load
  templates = { "builtin" },
  -- When true, tries to detect a green color from your colorscheme to use for success highlight
  auto_detect_success_color = true,
  -- Patch nvim-dap to support preLaunchTask and postDebugTask
  dap = true,
  -- Configure the task list
  task_list = {
    -- Default detail level for tasks. Can be 1-3.
    default_detail = 1,
    -- Width dimensions can be integers or a float between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.4 for 40%)
    -- min_width and max_width can be a single value or a list of mixed integer/float types.
    -- max_width = {100, 0.2} means "the lesser of 100 columns or 20% of total"
    max_width = { 100, 0.2 },
    -- min_width = {40, 0.1} means "the greater of 40 columns or 10% of total"
    min_width = { 40, 0.1 },
    -- optionally define an integer/float for the exact width of the task list
    width = nil,

## Running tasks

The easiest way to select and run a task is `:OverseerRun`. This will open a `vim.ui.select` dialog and allow the user to select a task. Once selected, if the task requires any [parameters](#parameters), it will prompt the user for input. Once all inputs are satisfied, the task is started.

If you want to customize how the tasks are searched, selected, or run, you can call `overseer.run_template` directly. Some examples:

```lua
-- Run the task named "make all"
-- equivalent to :OverseerRun make all
overseer.run_template({name = "make all"})
-- Run the default "build" task
-- equivalent to :OverseerRun BUILD
overseer.run_template({tags = {overseer.TAG.BUILD}})
-- Run the task named "serve" with some default parameters
overseer.run_template({name = "serve", params = {port = 8080}})
-- Create a task but do not start it
overseer.run_template({name = "make", autostart = false}, function(task)
  -- do something with the task
end)
-- Run a task and immediately open the floating window
overseer.run_template({name = "make"}, function(task)
  if task then
    overseer.run_action(task, 'open float')
  end
end)
-- Run a task and always show the parameter prompt
overseer.run_template({name = "npm watch", prompt = "always"})
```

## Task list

![Screenshot from 2022-07-22 08-44-37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/180475623-1e9a9612-5a93-4520-a9bc-4e12b0496411.png)

Control the task list with `:OverseerOpen`, `:OverseerClose`, and `:OverseerToggle`.

The task list displays all tasks that have been created. It shows the task status, name, and a
summary of the task output (controlled by the `on_output_summarize` component). You can show more or
less detail for a single task with `<C-l>` and `<C-h>` (by default), or for all tasks with `L` and
`H`.

`?` will show you a list of all the keybindings, and `<CR>` will open up a menu of all
[actions](#actions) that you can perform on the selected task.

When a task is disposed, it will be removed from the task list. By default, tasks will be disposed 5
minutes after they finish running (controlled by the `on_complete_dispose` component).

## Task editor

<img width="515" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-16 at 9 57 43 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/179364674-526c8cbc-0cd8-48b0-ad68-3140c10178eb.png">

The task editor allows you to change the components on a task by hand. You shouldn't need to do this
often (if you find yourself frequently making the same edits, consider turning that into an
[action](#actions)), but it can be useful for experimentation and tweaking values on the fly.

There are two ways to get to the task editor: `:OverseerBuild` will open it on a new task, and for
existing tasks (that are not running) you can use the `edit` action.

For the most part you can edit the values like a normal buffer, but there is a lot of magic involved
to produce a "form-like" experience. For enum fields, you can autocomplete the possible values with
omnicomplete (`<C-x><C-o>`). To delete a component, just delete its name (`dd` works fine). To add a
new component, create a blank line (I typically use `o`)

## Third-party integrations

### Lualine

There is a drop-in lualine component available. Use like:

```lua
require("lualine").setup({
  sections = {
    lualine_x = { "overseer" },
  },
})
```

Or with options:

```lua
require("lualine").setup({
  sections = {
    lualine_x = { {
      "overseer",
      label = '',     -- Prefix for task counts
      colored = true, -- Color the task icons and counts
      symbols = {
        [overseer.STATUS.FAILURE] = "F:",
        [overseer.STATUS.CANCELED] = "C:",
        [overseer.STATUS.SUCCESS] = "S:",
        [overseer.STATUS.RUNNING] = "R:",
      },
      unique = false,     -- Unique-ify non-running task count by name
      name = nil,         -- List of task names to search for
      name_not = false,   -- When true, invert the name search
      status = nil,       -- List of task statuses to display
      status_not = false, -- When true, invert the status search
    } },
  },
})
```

### Neotest

To run all neotest processes using overseer, add it as a custom consumer:

```lua
require('neotest').setup({
  consumers = {
    overseer = require("neotest.consumers.overseer"),
  },
})
```

This will automatically hook `neotest.run` and force it to use overseer to run tests wherever possible. If you would instead like to only use the overseer consumer explicitly, you can disable the monkey patching:

```lua
require('neotest').setup({
  consumers = {
    overseer = require("neotest.consumers.overseer"),
  },
  overseer = {
    enabled = true,
    -- When this is true (the default), it will replace all neotest.run.* commands
    force_default = false,
  },
})

-- Now neotest.run is unchanged; to run tests with overseer use:
neotest.overseer.run({})
```

You can customize the default components of neotest tasks by setting the `default_neotest` component alias (when unset it maps to `default`).

```lua
require('overseer').setup({
  component_aliases = {
    default_neotest = {
      "on_output_summarize",
      "on_exit_set_status",
      "on_complete_notify",
      "on_complete_dispose",
    },
  }
})
```

### DAP

If you have both overseer and [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) installed, overseer will automatically run the `preLaunchTask` and `postDebugTask` when present in a debug configuration.

## Architecture

### Tasks

Tasks represent a single command that is run. They appear in the [task list](#task-list), where you can manage them (start/stop/restart/edit/open terminal). You can create them directly, either with `:OverseerBuild` or via the API `require('overseer.task').new()`.

Most of the time, however, you will find it most convenient to create them using [templates](#templates).

### Components

Tasks are built using an [entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system). By itself, all a task does is run a command in a terminal. Components are used to add more functionality. There are components to display a summary of the output in the [task list](#task-list), to show a notification when the task finishes running, and to set the task results into neovim diagnostics.

Components are designed to be easy to remove, customize, or replace. If you want to customize some aspect or behavior of a task, it's likely that it will be done through components.

See [custom components](#custom-components) for how to customize them or define your own, and [components](doc/components.md) for a list of built-in components.

**Note**: both tasks and components are designed to be serializable. They avoid putting things like functions in their constructors, and as a result can easily be serialized and saved to disk.

### Templates

Templates provide a way to construct a task, along with other metadata that aid in selecting and starting that task. They are the primary way to define tasks for overseer, and they are what appears when you use the command `:OverseerRun`.

When you want to add custom tasks that you can run, templates are the way to go. See [custom tasks](#custom-tasks) for more.

## Customization

### Custom tasks

There are two ways to define a task for overseer.

**1) directly registering**

```lua
overseer.register_template({
  -- Template definition (see below)
})
```

**2) as a module**

Similar to [custom components](#custom-components), templates can be lazy-loaded from a module in the `overseer.template` namespace. It is recommended that you namespace your tasks inside of a folder (e.g. `overseer/template/myplugin/first_task.lua`, referenced as `myplugin.first_task`). To load them, you would pass the require path in setup:

```lua
overseer.setup({
  templates = { "builtin", "myplugin.first_task" },
})
```

If you have multiple templates that you would like to expose as a bundle, you can create an alias module. For example, put the following into `overseer/template/myplugin/init.lua`:

```lua
return { "first_task", "second_task" }
```

This is how `builtin` references all of the different built-in templates.

#### Template definition

The definition of a template looks like this:

```lua
{
  -- Required fields
  name = "Some Task",
  builder = function(params)
    -- This must return an overseer.TaskDefinition
    return {
      -- cmd is the only required field
      cmd = {'echo'},
      -- additional arguments for the cmd
      args = {"hello", "world"},
      -- the name of the task (defaults to the cmd of the task)
      name = "Greet",
      -- set the working directory for the task
      cwd = "/tmp",
      -- additional environment variables
      env = {
        VAR = "FOO",
      },
      -- the list of components or component aliases to add to the task
      components = {"my_custom_component", "default"},
      -- arbitrary table of data for your own personal use
      metadata = {
        foo = "bar",
      },
    }
  end,
  -- Optional fields
  desc = "Optional description of task",
  -- Tags can be used in overseer.run_template()
  tags = {overseer.TAG.BUILD},
  params = {
    -- See :help overseer.params
  },
  -- Determines sort order when choosing tasks. Lower comes first.
  priority = 50,
  -- Add requirements for this template. If they are not met, the template will not be visible.
  -- All fields are optional.
  condition = {
    -- A string or list of strings
    -- Only matches when current buffer is one of the listed filetypes
    filetype = {"c", "cpp"},
    -- A string or list of strings
    -- Only matches when cwd is inside one of the listed dirs
    dir = "/home/user/my_project",
    -- Arbitrary logic for determining if task is available
    callback = function(search)
      print(vim.inspect(search))
      return true
    end,
  },
}
```

#### Template providers

Template providers are used to generate multiple templates dynamically. The main use case is generating one task per target (e.g. for a makefile), but can be used for any situation where you want the templates themselves to be generated at runtime.

Providers are created the same way templates are (with `overseer.register_template`, or by putting them in a module). The structure is as follows:

```lua
{
  generator = function(search)
    -- Return a list of templates
    -- See the built-in providers for make or npm for an example
    return {...}
  end,
  -- Optional. Same as template.condition
  condition = function(search)
    return true
  end,
}
```

### Actions

Actions can be performed on tasks by using the `RunAction` keybinding in the task list, or by the `OverseerQuickAction` and `OverseerTaskAction` commands. They are simply a custom function that will do something to or with a task.

Browse the set of built-in actions at [lua/overseer/task_list/actions.lua](lua/overseer/task_list/actions.lua)

You can define your own or disable any of the built-in actions in the call to setup():

```lua
overseer.setup({
  actions = {
    ["My custom action"] = {
      desc = "This is an optional description. It may be omitted.",
      -- Optional function that will determine when this action is available
      condition = function(task)
        if task.name == "foobar" then
          return true
        else
          return false
        end
      end,
      run = function(task)
        -- Your custom logic here
      end,
    },

    -- Disable built-in actions by setting them to 'false'
    watch = false,
  },
  -- You can optionally add keymaps to run your action in the task list
  -- It will always be available in the "RunAction" menu, but it may be
  -- worth mapping it directly if you use it often.
  task_list = {
    bindings = {
      ['P'] = '<CMD>OverseerQuickAction My custom action<CR>',
    }
  }
})
```

### Custom components

When components are passed to a task (either from a template or a component alias), they can be specified as either a raw string (e.g. `"on_complete_dispose"`) or a table with configuration parameters (e.g. `{"on_complete_dispose", timeout = 10}`).

Components are lazy-loaded via requiring in the `overseer.component` namespace. For example, the `timeout` component is loaded from `lua/overseer/component/timeout.lua`. It is _recommended_ that for plugins or personal use, you namespace your own components behind an additional directory. For example, place your component in `lua/overseer/component/myplugin/mycomponent.lua`, and reference it as `myplugin.mycomponent`.

Paths given are all relative to any runtimepath (`:help rtp`), so in practice it's probably easiest to put it in `~/.config/nvim`. The full path to your custom component would then become `~/.config/nvim/lua/overseer/component/myplugin/mycomponent.lua`.

The component definition should look like the following example:

```lua
return {
  desc = "Include a description of your component",
  -- Define parameters that can be passed in to the component
  params = {
    -- See :help overseer.params
  },
  -- Optional, default true. Set to false to disallow editing this component in the task editor
  editable = true,
  -- When false, don't serialize this component when saving a task to disk
  serializable = true,
  -- The params passed in will match the params defined above
  constructor = function(params)
    -- You may optionally define any of the methods below
    return {
      on_init = function(self, task)
        -- Called when the task is created
        -- This is a good place to initialize resources, if needed
      end,
      ---@return nil|boolean
      on_pre_start = function(self, task)
        -- Return false to prevent task from starting
      end,
      on_start = function(self, task)
        -- Called when the task is started
      end,
      ---@param soft boolean When true, the components are being reset but the *task* is not. This is used to support commands that are watching the filesystem and rerunning themselves on file change.
      on_reset = function(self, task, soft)
        -- Called when the task is reset to run again
      end,
      ---@return table
      on_pre_result = function(self, task)
        -- Called when the task is finalizing.
        -- Return a map-like table value here to merge it into the task result.
        return {foo = {"bar", "baz"}}
      end,
      ---@param result table A result table.
      on_result = function(self, task, result)
        -- Called when a component has results to set. Usually this is after the command has completed, but certain types of tasks may wish to set a result while still running.
      end,
      ---@param status overseer.Status Can be CANCELED, FAILURE, or SUCCESS
      ---@param result table A result table.
      on_complete = function(self, task, status, result)
        -- Called when the task has reached a completed state.
      end,
      ---@param status overseer.Status
      on_status = function(self, task, status)
        -- Called when the task status changes
      end,
      ---@param data string[] Output of process. See :help channel-lines
      on_output = function(self, task, data)
        -- Called when there is output from the task
      end,
      ---@param lines string[] Completed lines of output, with ansi codes removed.
      on_output_lines = function(self, task, lines)
        -- Called when there is output from the task
        -- Usually easier to deal with than using on_output directly.
      end,
      ---@param code number The process exit code
      on_exit = function(self, task, code)
        -- Called when the task command has completed
      end,
      on_dispose = function(self, task)
        -- Called when the task is disposed
        -- Will be called IFF on_init was called, and will be called exactly once.
        -- This is a good place to free resources (e.g. timers, files, etc)
      end,
      ---@param lines string[] The list of lines to render into
      ---@param highlights table[] List of highlights to apply after rendering
      ---@param detail number The detail level of the task. Ranges from 1 to 3.
      render = function(self, task, lines, highlights, detail)
        -- Called from the task list. This can be used to display information there.
        table.insert(lines, "Here is a line of output")
        -- The format is {highlight_group, lnum, col_start, col_end}
        table.insert(highlights, {'Title', #lines, 0, -1})
      end,
    }
  end,
}
```

#### Task result

A note on the Task result table: there is technically no schema for it, as the only things that interact with it are components and actions. However, there are a couple of built-in uses for specific keys of the table:

**diagnostics**: This key is used for diagnostics. It should be a list of quickfix items (see `:help setqflist`) \
**error**: This key will be set when there is an internal overseer error when running the task

### Parameters

Parameters are a schema-defined set of options. They are used by both [components](#components) and [templates](#templates) to expose customization options.

```lua
local params = {
  my_var = {
    type = "string",
    -- Optional fields that are available on any type
    name = "More readable name",
    desc = "A detailed description",
    validate = function(value)
      return true,
    end,
    optional = true,
    default = "foobar",
  }
}
```

The following types are available:

```lua
{
  type = "string"
}
{
  type = "boolean"
}
{
  type = "number"
}
{
  type = "integer"
}
{
  type = "list",
  subtype = {
    type = "string"
  },
  delimiter = ",",
}
{
  type = "enum",
  choices = {"ONE", "TWO", "THREE"},
}
{
  -- This is used when the value is too complex to be represented or edited by the user in the task editor.
  -- It should generally only be used by components (which are usually configured programmatically)
  -- and not templates (which usually prompt the user for their parameters)
  type = "opaque"
}
```

### Highlights

Overseer defines the following highlights override them to customize the colors.

| Group                | description                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OverseerPENDING`    | Pending tasks                                           |
| `OverseerRUNNING`    | Running tasks                                           |
| `OverseerSUCCESS`    | Succeeded tasks                                         |
| `OverseerCANCELED`   | Canceled tasks                                          |
| `OverseerFAILURE`    | Failed tasks                                            |
| `OverseerTask`       | Used to render the name of a task or template           |
| `OverseerTaskBorder` | The separator in the task list                          |
| `OverseerOutput`     | The output summary in the task list                     |
| `OverseerComponent`  | The name of a component in the task list or task editor |
| `OverseerField`      | The name of a field in the task or template editor      |

## Parsing output

The primary way of parsing output with overseer is the `on_output_parse` component.

```lua
-- Definition of a component that parses output in the form of:
-- /path/to/file.txt:123: This is a message
-- You would typically use this in the components list of a task definition returned by a template
{"on_output_parse", parser = {
  -- Put the parser results into the 'diagnostics' field on the task result
  diagnostics = {
    -- Extract fields using lua patterns
    { "extract", "^([^%s].+):(%d+): (.+)$", "filename", "lnum", "text" },
  }
}}
```

This is a simple example, but the parser library is flexible enough to parse nearly any output format. See more detailed documentation in [the parsers doc](doc/parsers.md).

You can of course create your own components to parse output leveraging the `on_output` or `on_output_lines` methods. The integration should be straightforward; see [on_output_parse.lua](lua/overseer/component/on_output_parse.lua) to see how the built-in component leverages these methods.

## VS Code tasks

Overseer can read [VS Code's tasks.json file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks). By default, VS Code tasks will show up when you `:OverseerRun`. Overseer is _nearly_ at feature parity, but it's not quite (nor will it ever be) at 100%.

Some VS Code extensions add additional tasks, task types, or problem matchers. You can't install those extensions for neovim, but there are ways to similarly extend the functionality of overseer. See [Extending VS Code tasks](doc/extending_vscode.md) for more information.

Supported features:

- Task types: process, shell, typescript, node
- [Standard variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_variable-substitution)
- [Input variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference#_input-variables) (e.g. `${input:variableID}`)
- [Problem matchers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_processing-task-output-with-problem-matchers)
- Built-in library of problem matchers and patterns (e.g. `$tsc` and `$jshint-stylish`)
- [Compound tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_compound-tasks) (including `dependsOrder = sequence`)
- [Background tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_background-watching-tasks)
- `group` (sets template tag; supports `BUILD`, `TEST`, and `CLEAN`) and `isDefault` (sets priority)
- [Operating system specific properties](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_operating-system-specific-properties)
- Integration with [launch.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launchjson-attributes) (see [DAP](#dap))

Unsupported features:

- task types: gulp, grunt, jake
- shell-specific quoting
- Specifying a custom shell to use
- `problemMatcher.fileLocation`
- `${workspacefolder:*}` variables
- `${config:*}` variables
- `${command:*}` variables
- The `${defaultBuildTask}` variable
- Custom problem matcher patterns may fail due to differences between JS and vim regex (notably vim regex doesn't support non-capturing groups `(?:.*)` or character classes inside of brackets `[\d\s]`)
- [Output behavior](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_output-behavior) (probably not going to support this)
- [Run behavior](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_run-behavior) (probably not going to support this)

## Running tasks sequentially

There are currently two ways to get tasks to run sequentially. The first is by using the [dependencies](doc/components.md#dependencies) component. For example, if you wanted to create a `npm serve` task that runs `npm build` first, you could create it like so:

```lua
overseer.run_template({name = 'npm serve', autostart = false}, function(task)
  if task then
    task:add_component({'dependencies', task_names = {
      'npm build',
      -- You can also pass in params to the task
      {'shell', cmd = 'sleep 10'},
    }, sequential = true})
    task:start()
  end
end)
```

Another approach to running tasks in a specific order is to use the [orchestrator](lua/overseer/strategy/orchestrator.lua) strategy. This creates a single "orchestration" task that is responsible for running the other tasks in the correct order. You can create it like so:

```lua
local task = overseer.new_task({
  name = "Build and serve app",
  strategy = {
    "orchestrator",
    tasks = {
      "make clean", -- Step 1: clean
      {             -- Step 2: build js and css in parallel
         "npm build",
        { "shell", cmd = "lessc styles.less styles.css" },
      },
      "npm serve",  -- Step 3: serve
    },
  },
})
task:start()
```

Lastly, you can always leverage the `.vscode/tasks.json` format to specify task dependencies using the `dependsOn` keyword. It will use one of the two above methods under the hood.

## Alternatives

There are several other job/task plugins in the neovim ecosystem. To me, the main differentiating features that overseer offers are **unparalleled extensibility** and the **most complete support for `tasks.json`**. If you're still shopping around, these are the others that I'm aware of (please submit a PR if I'm missing any):

## API

As overseer is in beta status, the API is not completely solidified. Breaking change _may_ be made if necessary to improve the plugin, but they _will not_ be made unless absolutely necessary. Wherever possible, functions will be gracefully deprecated with clear migration messages.

The official API surface includes:

- All functions exposed in [overseer/init.lua](lua/overseer/init.lua)
- Config options passed to `setup()`
- [Components](#components), including names and parameters
- [Commands](#commands)
- [Parsers](#parsing-output), including names and parameters

## FAQ

**Q: Why do my tasks disappear after a while?**

The default behavior is for completed tasks to get _disposed_ after a 5 minute timeout. This frees their resources and removes them from the task list. You can change this by editing the `component_aliases` definition to tweak the timeout (`{"on_complete_dispose", timeout = 900}`), only dispose succeeded/failed tasks (`{"on_complete_dispose", statuses = {"SUCCESS"}}`), or delete the "on_complete_dispose" component entirely. In that case, tasks will stick around until manually disposed.

**Q: How can I debug when something goes wrong?**

The `overseer.log` file can be found at `:echo stdpath('log')` or `:echo stdpath('cache')`. If you need, you can crank up the detail of the logs by adjusting the level:

```lua
overseer.setup({
  log = {
    {
      type = "file",
      filename = "overseer.log",
      level = vim.log.levels.DEBUG, -- or TRACE for max verbosity
    },
  },
})
```

**Q: Can I use this to asynchronously lint my files on save?**

You absolutely can. All the pieces are here to build something like ALE, it just needs the configs for different lint tools. Personally, I think that the existing plugin ecosystem has solved this sufficiently well and I don't see a value add from building _another_ on top of overseer. I'm using [null-ls](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim) in my own config and think it's great.
